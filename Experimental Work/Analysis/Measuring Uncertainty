#The uncertainty in the experimental data (electron/ion density [ne, ni] and electron temperature [Te]) comes the noisy current-voltage signal, 
#the probe length, and probe diameter. We need to find the uncertainty caused by each and sum them up at the end. 

#We generally implement Savitzky Golay filtering and adjacent averaging to de-noise the signal. 
#To find the uncertainty caused by each, we can obtain ne, ni, Te with and witout filtering or adjacent average,
# and the difference between the computed parameters is simply the uncertainty.

#The same concept applies to probe length and diameter. We can calculate how the uncertainty in the probe length and 
# diameter affects ne, ni and Te. 

#At last, we simply sum up the uncertainty caused by Savitzky Golay smoothing, adjacent average, probe diameter, and probe length
# to obtain the overall uncertainty in the obtained ne, ni and Te.
