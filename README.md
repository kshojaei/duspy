A steady-state zero dimensional model of argon-hydrogen plasma seeded with copper nanoparticles that emit electrons due to photoemission and field-assisted thermionic emission.

Th model consists of four modules which iteratively solve for plasma parameters given known value of particle density and radius. The model accounts for the power distribution, ionization balance, particle heat transfer, and electron kinetics in a dusty plasma environment.
